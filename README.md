# The Solidity cat shop tutorial

Although the pet shop tutorial is an awesome guide, it lacks elements related to a real example. I decided to create a new version of the tutorial build from scratch. This guide focus on teaching one of the most confusing concepts of solidity: Mappings. Also, I switched from reactjs to vuejs to build the user interface.
I promise you that even if you are familiar with solidity you will find this tutorial very useful.
